# Consent Management Starter Kit

Welcome to the complex world of consent and preference management in Salesforce! 

This guide is intended to provide a good starting point to manage user consent and preferences utilizing the Consent Data Model in Salesforce and give you a foundation for your solution.

**Important Considerations**

 - Because managing consent in Salesforce is not a "plug and play" solution and there are many ways to solve this complex scenario, don't treat this document as your "silver bullet" but a place to get inspired and get started. 
 - This guide assumes that you are utilizing Salesforce Sales or Service Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud Engagement. If you utilize a different product such as Salesforce Data Cloud or Pardot this guide might not serve you as well but still could be useful.

Finally, this is a living guide. As I develop more components for the starter kit I will continue to upload them in this repository. Enjoy!
